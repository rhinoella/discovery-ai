# DiscoveryAI
## 3rd Place Project for the Cambridge LLM x Law Hackathon

DiscoveryAI is a way to connect lawyers and SMBs (Small-medium buisinesses).
We provide a platform that allows users to upload case details/evidence (multi-modal) which is then
categorised, described by an LLM and used to create an outline/valuation of the case.
